<p>For Project 3 I decided to expand on my topic from last week, Video Games. I thought the topic fit this weeks lessons again well. I had a lot of fun adapting my code ideas to the new topics such as Objects, JSON, and making my story better because of it. I hope you enjoy my code and my story.</p>
